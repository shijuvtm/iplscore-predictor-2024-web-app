# Iplscore-Predictor-2024-Web-App
## Project Description
 ### The IPL Cricket Score Prediction project aims to predict the total score of a team for a match. The main objective of this project using the machine learning algorithm is to develop a model that can accurately predict the score of an IPL match based on various factors such as over,current score,venue,bat_team, bowl_team, runs_last_5, wicket_last_5.
## Tools Used
### 1. Python
 ### Python has been chosen as the primary programming language because of its versatility and strong library environment. It provides a wide range of frameworks and tools designed specifically for use in data science and machine learning projects.
### 2. Jupyter Notebook
 ### This interactive development environment allows code cells to be created, run, and documented. It is designed for software developers. It is widely used for exploratory data analysis and visualisations, as well as for the iterative development of machine learning models.
### 3.Pandas
 ### A powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis is called Pandas. It offers data structures, such as DataFrames, that optimise the management and processing of structured data. Pandas' extensive feature set for filtering, transforming, and cleaning datasets makes it the ideal tool for preprocessing work.
### 4. NumPy:
 ### NumPyis an essential Python tool for scientific computing. It allows efficient numerical operations on matrices and multi-dimensional arrays. NumPy must be used to do the mathematical computations and data processing tasks required for machine learning.
### 5. Scikit-learn is a comprehensive Python machine learning library. It offers a broad range of methods and resources for model selection, evaluation, regression, classification, and clustering. Machine learning model construction and evaluation are made simpler by Scikit-learn's extensive capabilities and its visualisation API.
### 6. Matplotlib and Seaborn: 
 ### These two popular Python tools are used for data visualisation. There are many different plotting tools available with Matplotlib, however Seaborn provides more intricate statistical visualisations. With the aid of these libraries, it is possible to create educational plots, charts, and visualisations that effectively communicate results and glean insights from data.
### 7. Scipy: 
 ### Scipy is a Python library designed for scientific and statistical computing. It can test hypotheses and perform a wide range of statistical operations on probability distributions. Scipy can be used for feature selection, statistical analysis, and evaluating the performance of predictivemodels for the IPL score prediction project.
### 8. A variety of machine learning algorithms, such as gradient boosting, support vector regression, random forest, and linear regression, are used in the project. To implement these algorithms, appropriate Python tools and frameworks such as Scikit-learn, XGBoost, or LightGBM are utilised. The criteria and specifics of the IPL score prediction challenge are taken into consideration when choosing an algorithm.
